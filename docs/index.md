## 1. Introduction

<strong>MailFit</strong> is an All-in-one newsletter plugin for Wordpress which includes everything you need to create, send, track and profit from email marketing. It also comes with powerful tools to automate sending your email campaigns as well as following up once your email is opened or clicked.

Just install the MailFit plugin and you can send marketing emails without any limitation. With Wordpress + MailFit, you can get rid of expensive email services like Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign... as now you have full control over the entire newsletter system of your own.

MailFit can be configured to send email through your own SMTP servers like Postfix, Exim, Sendmail or Qmail. It can also integrate with other email service provider like Amazon SES, SendGrid, Mailgun, ElasticEmail, SparkPost...

MailFit is made seamlessly integrated with Wordpress. You can manage your email lists/campaigns right from the Wordpress admin dashboard. You can easily send an email campaign to all Wordpress users.


## 2. Installation

MailFit is built as a Wordpress plugin, so you can install it normally the way you can do with any other Wordpress plugin. The followings are required by MailFit:

* Operating System: Linux (RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.). Unfortunately we have yet to support Windows or Mac OS
* PHP Version: 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 or higher
* MySQL Version: >= 5.x
* Application server: Apache, Nginx
* The followings PHP/Apache extensions must be enabled: mod_rewrite
* The followings PHP/Apache extensions must be disabled: open_basedir, mod_security

Below are the PHP extensions that are required for installing MailFit:

* Mbstring
* OpenSSL
* Socket
* PDO Driver
* Tokenizer
* PHP Zip Archive
* IMAP Extension

Don't worry if you are not sure which extensions are available on your server, MailFit will check and prompt you to install any missing one during the installation wizard. Suppose your Wordpress source is located at `/user/www/wordpress`, then the installation steps are as follows:

* Upload mailfit-8.x.x.zip to your Wordpress `plugins` folder
* Extract the Mailfit zipped file, you will come up with a MailFit folder at `/user/www/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mailfit`
* Login to the Wordpress admin dashboard
* Go to the Plugins menu, you will see the MailFit plugin in the list
* Activate the plugin, then you will see the MailFit menu item in the menu bar on the right
* The first time you click on the MailFit menu, you need to go through the configuration wizard to finish setting it up
* Remember to capture the CronJob generated by MailFit and install it onto your hosting server
* You're all done

Now you are ready to create your first email campaign!

## 3. Create your first campaign

In order to send an email campaign, the followings are required:

* A sending server (an SMTP server or a 3rd service) which actually delivers our emails
* A mail list containing the subscribers to whom we're are sending emails to

### 3.1. Add a sending server

You must configure at least one sending server for the system. Go to menu _**MailFit > Sending Servers**_, then choose a sending server type to add. As of version 8.x, the following sending server types are supported by Mailfit:

* **Standard SMTP**: send email through an internal/external SMTP service
* **Sendmail**: send email directly through the `sendmail` program on the hosting server
* **PHP Mail**: send email directly through the `mail()` function of PHP
* **Amazon SES API/SMTP**: send email through Amazon Simple Mail Service, using either Amazon's web API or standard SMTP connection
* **Mailgun API/SMTP**: send email through Mailgun, using either Mailgun's web API or standard SMTP connection
* **SendGrid API/SMTP**: send email through SendGrid, using either SendGrid's web API (v2) or standard SMTP connection
* **ElasticEmail API/SMTP**: send email through ElasticEmail, using its web API (v2) or standard SMTP connection
* **SparkPost API/SMTP**: send email through SparkPost, using its web API or standard SMTP connection
* more to be supported...

### 3.2. Create a mail list & campaign

After you have setup the sending server, the next step is to create a mail list of all your subscribers, go to _**MailFit > Lists > Create List**_. Then you can add subscribers to your list (or potential subscribers can subscribe to your list through MailFit supscription form). You can also import subscribers from a CSV file or from your Wordpress users.

Once your mail list is ready, you can create an email campaign to send to your list. _Go to **Campaigns** > **Create Campaign**_, choose the mail list to send and follow the steps to setup and send your campaign.

That's it! You can always track your Campaign's email delivery status (Sent/Bounced/Open) in the Campaign statistics page.

## 5. Common issues & solutions

### The open_basedir restriction in effect

If you are getting an error like this while trying to open the plugin dashboard:

```
ErrorException in ..plugins/mailfit/app/Library/Tool.php line 637:
is_executable(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/usr/bin/php) is not within the allowed path(s): (/home/user/webapps/mailfit/email:/var/lib/php/session:/tmp)
```
Or
```
ERROR: The directory [/storage/app] must be writable by the web server.
ERROR: The directory [/storage/framework] must be writable by the web server.
ERROR: The directory [/storage/logs] must be writable by the web server.
ERROR: The directory [/bootstrap/cache] must be writable by the web server.
```
although you are sure the directories are already writable.

Then it is very likely that the `open_basedir` setting is currently enabled on your server, which prevents the application from loading.
If you are using Plesk, you can go to the domain setting page to turn it off. See the screenshot below, make sure `open_basedir` is set to `none`.

### 404 Not Found
If you are getting an error similar to the following while opening the webapp:

```
Error -
The requested URL /install was not found on this server.
```

Then it is very likely that `mod_rewrite` is not yet enabled for your web application server. Please turn it on, restar the Apache/Nginx web server and refresh the page.

### 500 Internal Server Error

If you are getting 500 error, it is likely that it a file permission error. If you are on cPanel, make sure that the file/directory permission is correctly setup to `644` or `755` rather than `775`. Also make sure that the files/directories permission under the `public/` folder of MailFit are correctly setup too since changing the parent directory permission may not recursively apply to all its children.
